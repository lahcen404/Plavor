# 🍳 Foodieland. – Full-Stack Recipe Platform

**Foodieland.** is a modern full-stack web application for recipe discovery and management.
The project combines a powerful **Laravel 8.2 REST API** with a dynamic **Angular 21 frontend**, fully containerized using **Docker** for seamless development and deployment.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, secure authentication, PostgreSQL advanced querying, and professional API testing practices.

> **💡 Development workflow:** I work on each feature or task in its own Git branch. In this repository every task has its own branch, which is merged back to `main` when complete.
